# Foundry VTT Player 'Training' 1

1. Get a drink
2. Login and look at the learning resources and aims sections, watch the video etc
3. You can look at the checklist as you go through, after or ignore it

## How to login

1) Go to link provided
2) Stop to appreciate the art; if you can't see the hoff with puppies, give me a shout first as I may be playing
3) Choose your name, password is in discord so I don't save it here

## Player learning resources

I'd actually suggest doing both of these for confirmation

### Videos - pause and copy, good monkey

### Website - we got ourselves some readers here boys

## Aims
There are 2 night maps where you can properly interact with your tokens 
- crossroads
- forge
And other maps to marvel at:
- Faerun, very large map
- Sword Coast, Smaller map
- Bridge - two animated maps just to see how they load
- Large - large map what I made, to see how it loads

Anything else is me playing and you can ignore for now

All characters (should) have dark vision so shout if you can't see anything.

##  Checklist 

By the end of this can you:
- [ ] Maps
  - [ ] Move between maps; or 'scenes' as they're known
  - [ ] Load all the scenes ok, do some take ages etc
    - [ ] Note there should be a frames per second meter displaying in the top right of the screen, left of the sidebar tabs
  - [ ] Zoom in, out scroll etc
- [ ] Vision
    - [ ] Personal vision: If your token is selected you'll see your character's vision. 
      - [ ] You need to deselect it to see what you can see from others - just click somewhere else, or press ESC.
    - [ ] Party Vision: You all have independant vision on the map. This can be changed but to demonstrate how it works:
      - [ ] Calnius is helpfully holding a torch for you all to give light but is forgetting to tell you what he can see
      - [ ] Percival is letting you see through his darkvision, but he is on the ground and can't see through the rock near him
      - [ ] Understand the difference between Calius and Percival in terms of how they're helping you see? 
      - [ ] DMs need to make a decision on this I think. I think I want to try the former of:
        - [ ] Keep it like this. Means if a rogue is sneaking ahead you might have to tell people what you see and them the next character has to plot his route round the rock. Maybe you can't get there in time and need to re-evaluate when you see what's there?
        - [ ] Let everyone see everything, as we've been playing
- [ ] Movement
  - [ ] Move your character
    - [ ] Move your character through the ctrl/ space tool
    - [ ] Notice you can't walk through rocks, walls etc
    - [ ] Note that I can set diagonals to be a bit more costly to move in this version. I think the rules say diagonal is 5ft. Thoughts?
    - [ ] Rotate your token - we may have to get some top down tokens as having the facing direction could be nice? Thoughts?
    - [ ] Sneak around the crossroads map
    - [ ] Forge map: 
        - [ ] can you open the door (and close it after you) and see how that affects vision
        - [ ] can you hear the sounds by the forge?
- [ ] Toolbar/ HUD
    - [ ] Measure distance and spell effects (and tidy up after yourself)
    - [ ] Change your elevation
    - [ ] Apply the prone effect icon to yourself
- [ ] Character
    - [ ] Open your character sheet
    - [ ] Make various rolls, attacks, saves, normal stuff
    - [ ] Roll with advantage, disadvantage through ALT, CTRL, SHIFT keys
    - [ ] Roll from dndbeyond 
    - [ ] Drag an attack to the macro bar and roll from there
    - [ ] Detach an attack to a seperate window
- [ ] Combat - on crossroads
  - [ ] Can you detach the combat tracker to show on your screen and get back to chat on the right
  - [ ] Can you toggle your characters combat state and add your character to initiatve
- [ ] Have a play, later we'll look at 
    - [ ] Importing your character from Dndbeyond yourself
    - [ ] Torches/ lighting
    - [ ] MOAR Combat
- [ ] Extra credit, can you change your dice colour/ style
    - [ ] Hint: Game Settings> Configure Settings> Module Settings> Dice so Nice!
