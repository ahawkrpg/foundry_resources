## Somethings to notice.
### Personal vision
If your token is selected you'll see your character's vision. You need to deselect it to see what you can see from others - just click somewhere else, or press ESC - something drawing a little selection box somewhere helps.

### Seeing what others can see
You all have independant vision on the map. This can be changed but to demonstrate how it works:
*Calnius is helpfully holding a torch for you all to give light but is forgetting to tell you what he can see
*Weirdly, Percival is letting you see through his darkvision, but he is on the ground and can't see through the rock near him
